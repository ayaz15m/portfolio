We began week 2 by going over the weekend projects from week 1. Similar concepts
being used over again helped familiarize them to me. During the middle of week,
as a class we built the game 2048. I thought this was really cool that we can
use ruby to build the game. At the end of week 2 we were assigned to make a
blackjack game!
