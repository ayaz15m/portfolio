This week was a little bit different as we began to steer away from ruby and got
into TDD, Git, Middleman, HTML. I have never done testing before so the concept
of incorporating into the coding process was not that clear for me. But I think
like with any concept, practice and exposure over time will get me more accustomed
to it.

This week our weekend project consisted of writing a program with some kind of
character which can be tested and use git to put it onto Github. Then we needed
to create a HTML describing the project. For my program I made a bank account
which allows the user to withdraw and make deposits.

The tests I did for this project included: the balance is given without doing
anything, the balance after a deposit is made, the balance after a withdrawal is
made, and the balance after a deposit and a withdrawal are made together.

After adding the rest of the code, which displays output and lets user input info,
I had some trouble running the tests afterwards because I was trying to use different
values. This problem got solved by have the code required for the tests in one
class and the rest of the code in another class. Once the 2 classes were made
everything worked smoothly!
