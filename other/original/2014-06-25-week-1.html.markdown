Since the first day we hit the ground running. We started to use ruby right away.
Because I had no prior ruby experience some concepts were thrown at me which it
took some to get a good grasp on them. For me, the homework every night using
homework helped me to use and play around with the recently learned concepts. At
the end of week we were assigned a weekend project which required us to build a
concert application.

## About Me
